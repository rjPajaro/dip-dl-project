# DIP - Deep Learning Project
A research on fundus image classification of AMD using deep learning methods.

## Datasets used for this research
- ODIR - https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/andrewmvd/ocular-disease-recognition-odir5k
- RMFID - https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/andrewmvd/retinal-disease-classification
- STARE - https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vidheeshnacode/stare-dataset

## Image classification
We used 3 CNN-based classification models to achieve comparison upon which is most effective for this research. We are also limited to the following models due to the capability of our machines:
- CNN
- ResNet
- InceptionV3
